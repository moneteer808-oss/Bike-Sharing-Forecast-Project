- **Summer demand** (~5,644 rentals/day) is more than double **winter** (~2,604/day)
- Time series was **non-stationary** â†’ made stationary via **first-order differencing**
- Best-fitting model: **ARIMA(1,0,1)** on differenced data
- Short-term forecast shows **stable daily changes** (no strong trend)
